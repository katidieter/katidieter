## Hi, I'm Katieli Dieter 

 I am a data scientist with solid software engineering skills. My work focuses on geospatial science, mainly for the delivery business. I also worked for about 2 years as a data scientist in the logistics and acquisition domain. Before that, I worked as a software engineer, quality assurance, and tech lead, when I had the opportunity to improve my tech and product development knowledge.
 
I am passionate about solving problems using technology and I believe that data adds a lot of power to improve peoples's lives. During the last 11 years, I have participated in amazing projects and I wanna share what I learn, but majority of them are private, so I can show the whole thing. Now, I want to create my public cases and I hope it could be helpful to other tech/data lovers.
