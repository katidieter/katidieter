## Hi, I'm Katieli Dieter 

 Senior Data Scientist focused on antifraud systems and decision-making under uncertainty.

I build and scale data-driven solutions in environments where data is noisy, labels are imperfect, and decisions have real financial and operational consequences.

My background blends strong software engineering fundamentals with applied machine learning and analytics, with recent work centered on:

- fraud detection and risk modeling,

- cost-sensitive decision systems,

- model interpretability and human-in-the-loop workflows,

- network-based approaches to identify organized fraud.

I care not only about model performance, but about how models are used in practice — including interpretability, responsible AI, and alignment with business and operational constraints.

This GitHub contains curated projects and experiments reflecting how I approach real-world data problems, from exploration to deployment-oriented thinking.
